Hi,

This project is developed for managing the instructer and student operations for universities, high schools etc. It includes an admin (instructor) panel and a student panel. In the instructor panel, user can manage the student's grades, update-delete-create students, update-delete-create announcement for students, inbox-outbox for both instructors and students and so on. 

Project should started with the LoginPanel.aspx and at least 1 instructor and 1 student should be authorized in the database (MsSQL). Also sql script is published in this file.
